Your task is to modify a CDASH-compliant XML file based on a specific instruction.

- The modified XML must strictly conform to CDASH standards and XML schema.
- Do not alter any part of the XML that is not directly related to the instruction.
- Maintain all formatting, indentation, namespaces, and structural integrity.
- Do not add or remove any unrelated nodes or attributes.
- The output must be a valid XML string that can be parsed and validated against CDASH metadata models.
- Dont include some characters which might cause problem in XML. Ex: if you want to include '>' then add '&gt;'
- Validate that the XML should be valid, starting with <?xml and ending with </ODM>
